Summary: I learned that personal cyber risks often come from weak passwords, oversharing online, and clicking unsafe links. Defenses like using strong, unique passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, updating devices, and being cautious with online activity help reduce these risks. Building safe digital habits is the best way to stay protected.
Case Project 2-5: Your Defensive Stance. My main priority is protecting sensitive information like banking details, passwords, personal identification numbers, and private communications, since these could expose my finances, privacy, and safety if compromised. Given that I regularly use online accounts, social media, and digital services, the likelihood of exposure is moderate to high, especially if I fall into risky habits like reusing passwords or clicking suspicious links. The effort to protect my digital life is definitely worth it because even small steps—such as using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being mindful of what I share online—can prevent serious damage. While I already practice some good habits, my defensive stance could be improved by consistently updating my devices, backing up important files, and staying more alert to phishing attempts and scams.
Reflection: My personal practices will change by becoming more intentional and consistent with my digital security. I will start using stronger, unique passwords for every account and rely on a password manager to keep them organized. I’ll also make sure to enable two-factor authentication wherever it’s available and keep my devices updated with the latest security patches. I plan to be more cautious with what I share on social media, avoiding details that could be used for identity theft or security questions. Additionally, I’ll back up important files regularly and take extra time to verify suspicious emails or messages before clicking any links. These changes will help create stronger everyday habits that reduce my risk and better protect my privacy and safety online.
