 Cybersecurity is crucial because it protects sensitive data from theft, prevents attacks on critical infrastructure, and ensures the privacy of personal and business information. It involves practices, technologies, and processes designed to safeguard systems, networks, and devices from cyber threats like hacking, malware, and phishing. Basic cybersecurity measures include using strong passwords, updating software regularly, and being cautious about suspicious emails or links.

**Reflection:**  
Write 1–2 paragraphs about what you learned and why it matters. Connect it to everyday security habits or the workplace.  
 Cybersecurity is not just about protecting large institutions or government networks; it’s something that directly impacts our everyday lives. Simple habits, like using strong, unique passwords and avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks, are essential in preventing personal data from being compromised. In the workplace, ensuring that systems are secure and employees are trained on identifying phishing scams or handling confidential information appropriately can significantly reduce the risk of breaches. As we rely more on digital tools for both personal and professional use, practicing good cybersecurity habits becomes crucial in maintaining privacy and protecting against financial losses or identity theft.

The importance of cybersecurity also extends beyond individual responsibility it’s vital for businesses to create a culture of security awareness. This includes ensuring that everyone, from entry-level employees to executives, understands the potential risks of cyber threats and follows best practices for safeguarding data. By integrating cybersecurity into daily operations, both at home and in the workplace, we can mitigate risks and contribute to a more secure digital environment for everyone.
